# Installing Dependencies

This document provides step-by-step instructions for installing the necessary dependencies to support PDF generation and S3 storage in your application.

## Step 1: Initialize Your Project

If you haven't already set up a Node.js project, follow these steps:

1. **Create a New Directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir your-project-name
   cd your-project-name
   ```

2. **Initialize a New Node.js Project**:
   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```

## Step 2: Install Required Libraries

You need to install several libraries for PDF generation and AWS S3 interaction. Run the following commands in your project directory:

### Core Libraries

1. **Install `express`**:
   ```bash
   npm install express
   ```

2. **Install `cors`** (for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):
   ```bash
   npm install cors
   ```

3. **Install `dotenv`** (for environment variable management):
   ```bash
   npm install dotenv
   ```

4. **Install `aws-sdk`**:
   ```bash
   npm install aws-sdk
   ```

5. **Install `@aws-sdk/client-s3`**:
   ```bash
   npm install @aws-sdk/client-s3
   ```

6. **Install `@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner`**:
   ```bash
   npm install @aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner
   ```

### PDF Generation Libraries

7. **Install `jspdf`** and `jspdf-autotable`:
   ```bash
   npm install jspdf jspdf-autotable
   ```

### Verify Installation

To ensure that all dependencies have been installed correctly, check your `package.json` file. You should see all the installed packages listed under `dependencies`. 

You can also run the following command to verify that the packages are installed:

```bash
npm list --depth=0
```

## Step 3: Create Your Project Structure

Set up your project structure to organize your code effectively. Here’s a suggested folder structure:

```
your-project-name/
├── generated/            # For generated PDF files
├── services/             # For S3 services and other utilities
│   └── s3Service.js
├── lib/                  # For utility functions (like PDF generation)
│   └── generatePDF.js
├── routes/               # For route handling
│   └── PDFRoutes.js
├── .env                  # For environment variables
├── package.json          # Project metadata and dependencies
└── server.js             # Main server file
```

## Step 4: Create the `.env` File

In your project root, create a file named `.env` to store your AWS credentials securely. Add the following lines, replacing the placeholder values with your actual AWS credentials:

```plaintext
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key
AWS_REGION=your_region
```

### Notes:

- **AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID**: Your AWS access key ID.
- **AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY**: Your AWS secret access key.
- **AWS_REGION**: The AWS region where your S3 bucket is located (e.g., `us-east-1`).

## Conclusion

You have successfully installed all the necessary dependencies and set up your project structure. This setup will allow you to generate PDF invoices and interact with your Amazon S3 bucket for storage.
